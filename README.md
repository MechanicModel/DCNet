# Implementation of DCNet(Pytorch)

## Introduction
This is a Pytorch implementation for a Nasopharygneal Carcinoma segmengtation approach based on the densely connected deep convolutional neural network. The papaer has been pubilished on *Sensors*, Li, Y.; Han, G.; Liu, X. DCNet: Densely Connected Deep Convolutional Encoderâ€“Decoder Network for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Segmentation. Sensors 2021, 21, 7877. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21237877
